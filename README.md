## Concepts in Robotics
The repository is to systematically build examples and tools for
understanding robotics tools related to OS, algorithms, datastructures,
deep learning, OS, embedded linux, and much more.

It picks examples from the internet and implements them to understand the boiler
plate implementations and then gradually gets into the nuances of different
aspects of building a great robot.

Building great robots require proficiency in so many skills. This repository
over time tries to build that through simple examples. It is at this moment for
personal use. But more ideas are welcome.
